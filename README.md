I am solving the classification of MINST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset for sign language. 

Kaggle Link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datamunge/sign-language-mnist


For this ML Task, I am using Logistic regression algorithm for multiclass classifciation. I have custom built the algorithm from scratch in python without any help of third party libraries for the classification process. 
However I have used sk learn to visualize the data.
